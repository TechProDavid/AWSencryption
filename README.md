<h1>S3 Object encryption</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Considering the importance of data security for anyone who stores data in the cloud, encrypting data at rest ensures that only the encrypted format of the data can be viewed by anyone who gains access to the disks, thus making it useless for attackers. Though AWS offers several encryption mechanisms, in this lab I used Server-Side Encryptiion with Customer Manager Keys that were stored iin AWS Key Management services. This approach gives the customer control of the master key that generates data keys used by S3 to encrypt and decrypt data stored in its buckets.
